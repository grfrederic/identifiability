## identifiability
Supplementary code used in the research article "[Predictive power of non-identifiable models](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37939-8)" published in *Scientific Reports* (2023).

### Overview
The `identifiability` module contains definitions of studied models, utils for running MCMC and ODE solver configurations. The two notebooks (`generate data.ipynb`, `generate figures.ipynb`) were used to generate figures presented in the article.

### Requirements
For a list of Python modules see `requirements.txt`.
